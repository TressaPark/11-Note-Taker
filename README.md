## Description

Notetaker is an easy to navigate application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The application frontend was created by Trilogy Education Services, I built the backend and connected the two.

## Installation

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Usage

Please see Note Taker in action.
